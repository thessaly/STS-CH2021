Good morning, my name is Julieta.

I'm a STS PhD student from Argentina, currently living in Geneva, where I moved 3 years ago.

My current affiliation is CENIT, a research center on innovation studies in Buenos Aires, and one of the references in open science studies in the region.

# Agenda
1. The global open science hardware movement (GOSH)
2. An under-explored argument
3. Research question
4. Analytic framework
5. The cases
6. Findings
7. Conclusions and future research

???
Today I am going to present part of the work I've done for my PhD, which I will be defending by the end of march.

I will start with a brief description of the open science hardware movement and then move on to describe the research question and findings from our multiple case study.

# Open science hardware (OSH)

- Goal: open access to the design of science tools
- Highly diverse, multiple framings
- Sustained growth in the last 5 years
- Transnational networks > Global Open Science Hardware movement (GOSH)

???
Applying the freedoms of open source software to science tools including analog, digital, mechanical, bio, textiles, Investigaciones

Framings > hacker culture, open science movement, appropriate technology, transfeminism, critical pedagogies

Growth > influence in policy, funding for next 4 years, growing advocates inside and outside academia

# Democratizing access?

OSH advocates argue that:
- OSH is **more efficient** than proprietary equiment,
- OSH **democratizes** access to science and technology

But, in which way OSH enables more, and more diverse people to participate in science and technology that is useful for them, in their own contexts?

???
Most studies focus in the efficiency angle, while the democratizing aspect is discussed mostly from community Science

When I attended Chile 2017 meeting of GOSH, attendees from Africa and Latin America mostly discussed how OSH should be a tool for producing the science and technology they need, both in and out academia

So as part of my phd I wanted to understand more about the mechanisms of democratization in the global south, and what they mean in context

# Analytic framework
- Design Justice: the power of artifacts in allowing (or not) participations
- Domestication approach: which practical, cognitive, symbolic work is performed?
- Socially useful production: highly contextualized science and tech

???
DJ > useful as a framework to analyze the silent power of designs, and in this case, how open designs redistribute power accross the matrix of domination

Domestication > understand which are the different works needed to appropriate technology and how openness plays in that

Socially Useful Production > how are the interactions between users and producers of science and tech generating robust, contextualized science and technology

# The cases

|Gorgas tracker | Open Flexure   | Vuela   | KossamTor  |
|-|-|-|-|
|Peru   | UK/Tanzania   |Chile   | Cameroon  |
|Academic   | Academic   | Community   | Community   |
|Customized GPS tracker for studying malaria dispersion with indigenous communities in the Amazon |Low-cost 3D-printed research-grade microscope for malaria diagnosis   | Low cost easy to fly drones for community science  | Low cost incubators for rural women to produce yoghurt  |


???
Research design included an embedded multiple case study, a qualitative approach to explore the topic, through semi structured interviews and participant observation, plus analysis of documentation online.

Academic/community is a distinction made by practitioners

All cases part of GOSH, data collected between 2019/2020

# Findings (A)

.center[The way in which people participate depends on the goal of the project, and not of its context (academic/community)]

---
## Vuela: opening the process

> "Our goal wasn't so related to the drones, which were in the end a sort of excuse"

- Users first turn into manufacturers, and shortly after, developers
- Demands strong facilitation from organizes, who "translate" between fields of knowledge
- Focus on collaborative work and skill development, based on peer-to-peer learning

## Findings (B)
