STS-CH 2021 / Lausanne, Switzerland

???
Good morning, my name is Julieta.

I'm a STS PhD student from Argentina, currently living in Geneva, where I moved 3 years ago.

My current affiliation is CENIT, a research center on innovation studies in Buenos Aires, and one of the references in open science studies in the region.

# Agenda
1. The global open science hardware movement (GOSH)
<br>
2. An under-explored argument
<br>
3. Research question
<br>
4. Analytic framework
<br>
5. The cases
<br>
6. Findings
<br>
7. Conclusions and future research

???
Today I am going to present part of the work I've done for my PhD, which I will be defending by the end of march.

I will start with a brief description of the open science hardware movement and then move on to describe the research question and findings from our multiple case study.

# Open science hardware (OSH)

### Goal: open access to the design of science tools

- Highly diverse, multiple framings <br>
- Transnational networks > Global Open Science Hardware movement (GOSH)<br>
- Sustained growth in the last 5 years
<br>
<br>
<br>

???
OSH is a term that can be used to describe the practice of creating or modifying tools for science whose design is openly licensed

a discipline, artifacts and also a movement of people which had significant growth in the last 5 years, advoctating for OSH to become the default standard

Applying the freedoms of open source software to science tools including analog, digital, mechanical, bio, textiles

Goal: open access to the design of science tools, ubiquitous by 2025. Sub community of makers, open science move.

Framings > hacker culture, open science movement, appropriate technology, transfeminism, critical pedagogies

"A constant negotiation, as the only thing they have in common is the intention of opening the black box of science tools"

Growth > influence in policy, funding for next 4 years, growing advocates inside and outside academia

---
# Democratizing access?

OSH advocates argue that:
- OSH is **more efficient** than proprietary equiment,
- OSH **democratizes** access to science and technology

##.center[In which way OSH enables more, and more diverse people to develo science and technology they need, in their own contexts?]

???
There are two main arguments that advocates present pro OSH.

Most studies focus in the efficiency angle, which is feeding the policy discussions.

The democratizing aspect is discussed mostly from community Science, in terms of undone science, democratizing the agenda. However the studies in the global south are really scarce.

When I attended Chile 2017 meeting of GOSH, attendees from Africa and Latin America mostly discussed how OSH should be a tool for producing the science and technology they need, both in and out academia

Tech sovereignity, not a thing I hear in US or Europe gosh.

So as part of my phd I wanted to understand more about the mechanisms of democratization in the global south, and what they mean in context

# Analytic framework
- Design Justice: the power of artifacts in allowing (or not) participations
- Domestication approach: which practical, cognitive, symbolic work is performed?
- Socially useful production: highly contextualized science and tech

???
DJ > useful as a framework to analyze the silent power of designs, and in this case, how open designs redistribute power accross the matrix of domination

Domestication > understand which are the different works needed to appropriate technology and how openness plays in that

Socially Useful Production > how are the interactions between users and producers of science and tech generating robust, contextualized science and technology

|-|-|-|-|
|Peru   | UK/Tanzania   |Chile   | Cameroon  |
|Academic   | Academic   | Community   | Community   |
|University Fablab, visits to community of users   | Makerspace, users in Clinical research lab  | Community centre  | Makerspace close to rural settlement  |
|Customized GPS tracker for studying malaria dispersion with indigenous communities in the Amazon |Low-cost 3D-printed research-grade microscope for malaria diagnosis   | Low cost easy to fly drones for community science  | Low cost incubators for rural women to produce yoghurt  |

Open practices: modular design, iterative processes, open flow of information

???
Research design included an embedded multiple case study, a qualitative approach to explore the topic. All cases part of GOSH, data collected between 2018/2020 through semi structured interviews and participant observation, plus analysis of documentation online.

Academic/community is a distinction made by practitioners


## Cases

The selection includes 2 projects in latin america and 2 in africa, in academic and community contexts. It is worth mentioning that this is a distinction made by practitioners.

### Gorgas tracker
Is a project in Peru, from University Cayetano Heredia, born from the need of an epidemiologist to study the spread of malaria in indigenous populatinos in the peruvian amazon, related to human mobility.

They had almost no funding, and the commercially available gps trackers were not useful in the amazonian weather conditions, so they decided to build one. The results ended up influencing natinoal malaria control policy, and resulted in the creation of the health innovation lab.

Development and manufacturing are done inside the university fablab, users are in the indigenous community and health agents.

### Open Flexure
Is the most mature and one of the paradigmatic OSH projects.

The team  develops a low cost, fully 3d printed microscope for malaria diagnosis, completely manufactured locally, repairable locally too.

Developed in the UK at university of bath, manufactured in a makerspace in tanzania and used for clinical research at Ifakara Health Institute, again in Tanzania, it's accelerating diagnosis, limiteed by lack of equipment.


### Vuela
Moving to community projects, Vuela is a chilean project working at a community centre in the outskirts of Santiago.

The neighbours build low cost, repairable open source drones for community science, in this case mmonitoring the activity of a mining site nearby. They first replicated a spanish design and then started modifiying it. Their design was later adopted by academic researchers in agricultural science and climate change, and turned into a professional research instrument that is now available in 7 countries in latin america.

### kossamTor
A community project run at a makerspace in Cameroon, they produce do it yourself incubators, adapting a reliable open design, with really low cost materials. The goal is that rural women from a settlement near the makerspace can own incubators to produce yoghurt for feeding their families and commercializing.

### All projects share the core elemets of OSH practice:
- modular design (they can alter parts and functions without altering the whole functioning)
- rapid and iterative prototyping (using arduino-like boards and 3d printing, and testing with users)
- open licenses to allow free flow of information

# Findings (A)

###.center[Participation strategy depends on the goal of the project, and not of its context (academic/community)]

When the goal is in the product, participation follows a "division of labour" pattern

When the goal is in the process itself, "everyone does everything"

???
So the 1st finding is that the way in which people participate in these projects is not a function of their academic or community context, but of the ultimate goal: is it centered on the product or the process?

The typical roles we can find in the development of an OSH project mimic those of a proprietary project: developers/researchers, manufacturers and users.

- If product-centered, division of labour: people participate in roles
- If process-centered, participation is fluid accross the roles and boundaries are blurred

In most of the analyzed projects, this distinction still exists, but openness facilitates dialogue between the roles in particular using documentation as a vehicle, and iterative design as organizer of the dialogue.

---
## Vuela: opening the process

> "Our goal wasn't so related to the drones, which were in the end a sort of excuse"

- Users first turn into manufacturers, and shortly after, developers
- Demands strong facilitation from organizes, who "translate" between fields of knowledge
- Focus on collaborative work and skill development, based on peer-to-peer learning

???
- Starts by replication process
- Facilitators are hybrid roles academic/activists that speak both languages
- Which object is a crucial decision, it has to be attractive, desired
---
# Findings (B)

###.center[More participation of users along the process doesn't necessarily translate into direct benefits for them]

Process-oriented projects advance comparatively slowly than product-centered projects

Benefits are participant-centered instead of artifact-centered, in terms of capabilities

In contexts of urgency, product-centered mode gives users more direct benefits

????
There is always an organizing core, such as open source software

The resources for facilitation may be scarce, and projects can choose to dedicate them to dev instead

Difficult for the community to recognize the value of process-centered projects, how to measure?

---
## KossamTor

Rural women are involved in basic manufacturing and usage via workshops

The makerspace receives women once they gather the materials for the incubator, and guides them through the building and operations

???
More benefits than being involved in everything, would have demanded high facilitation that is not possible with resources of Makerspace

Urgency

---
# Findings (C)

###.center[Contexts, and in particular physical spaces, configure the diversity of participants]

### Women provide critical contextual information to projects
- in academia only as users
- in communities, shaping the problem

### Diversity of backgrounds
- "Subaltern design spaces" provide flexibility for sporadic participation
- Even in complex designs

???
How diverse is participation is an important question for OSH community, which is usually biased towards white, male cis participants.

In terms of gender diversity, in all cases women provide key information for contextualizing the developments, however in academic contexts they only occupy the role of users. In community cases, they shape the problem.

E.g. kossamtor microbiologists are all women, and realized that the incubator they were building for selling to university could be used for producing yogurt. Gendered scientization observed by Kimura, 2019 (care-related participation)

In terms of diversity of  backgrounds, the physical spaces where design activities are performed, is key.

The most diverse projects are those which move their activities to "subaltern spaces", or those spaces where science and tech design isn't expected to happen.

- Because of the existing territorial networks of this spaces, such as community centres or makerspaces
- Because they allow sporadic, more flexible participation (very important for voluntary work in vulnerable contexts)

---
## Gorgas tracker

> "We got our most useful insights from users, in particular women in the community"

- Locally accessible bill of materials
- Better interfaces for UX
- Resilient materials and workflows
- Artifacts are never facing total closure

???
What OSH enables here through iterative testing is that devs and manufacturers don't have to imagine the user, they can go and reach out, and enhance their designs based on this information

Repairable, adaptable to weather, usable by health agents and indigenous people

Multiple versions according to usage... living instruments

---
# Findings (D)

###.center[Available online documentation is a reflection of offline processes]

Some projects document during the process, some afterwards

If documentation used as tool for peer-to-peer learning:
  - During the processes
  - Multiple formats & languages
  - Better quality

Participants do not have to *imagine* who they talk to --> better docs

???
Documentation is core to open hardware practice, though an unbearable effort (pride/shame)

E.g. kossamTor> replication by whom? In which language?

Always replicable? Which platforms are enforced? Why github? Github makes no sense in community contexts.

---
## Open Flexure

Intense peer-to-peer learning processes between UK and Tanzania teams

Significant distance between disciplines and cultural backgrounds

Documentation advances slowly but is useful and clear for appropriation --> forks

???

---
# Wrap up

#### Product-oriented or process-oriented goals determine participation modes (fluid/labour division) besides context

#### Different types of benefits, more direct/faster if product oriented; long-term if process-oriented (demands intense facilitation)

#### Diversity of participants reflects the diversity of territorial networks (always higher when outside academia)

#### Online documentation becomes useful if it's a consequence of offline peer2peer learnings

---
# Future pathways

## Implications for practice: documentation, diversifying spaces, value benefits accordingly

## Implications for research & policy: how can OSH contribute to alter knowledge production politics in academia?
